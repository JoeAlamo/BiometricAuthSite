# Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication Web Service and Application

## Overview

This repository contains a web service and application I developed for my final year university project.

It is part of a biometric multi-factor authentication system. 
The RESTful JSON web service allows a symmetric challenge-response mutual authentication protocol to be performed, to verify the biometric identity of a user using cryptography (HAVE factor and ARE factor).
The web application provides a login system using traditional username and password credentials (KNOW factor). 
However, you are only able to login if your credentials are correct AND you have engaged in the biometric authentication protocol within the last 30 seconds.
